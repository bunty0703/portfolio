This project is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences in the field of web development. With a clean and modern design, it provides visitors with an easy-to-navigate interface to learn more about me, my work, and how to get in touch.
